This is built to work with Outlook 2007.
For this to work you will need to expose a few entities via AA..

LeadAddress
OpportunitiyContacts
TicketProblem

Remember to build and deploy after you check off the SData option for each of these.

You will also need to install Outlook Redemption onto your laptop. You can download and install the developer version. Please, if you plan to give/sell this tool to a customer I would ask you to support the developer of this tool and purchase a license.
